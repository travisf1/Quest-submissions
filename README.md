Emerald City Academy- Beginner Cadence Bootcamp (may 2022)


Chapter 1.0
Day 1 quest-
1- A blockchain is a distributed database that stores information electronically in digital format. It is structured so that all users contain control rather than a centralized third party. Blockchain differs from a standard database due to the way it compiles information in “blocks” and chains them together so that there is an irreversible timeline of data. For applications of blockchain such as Bitcoin, this means transactions are permanently recorded and can be viewed by anyone. Security within blockchain can be attributed to the decentralized nature, where the information is spread out between multiple network nodes. This means that if the information held within one node is altered, the others can cross reference the information within them and determine the node that has incorrect information. 

2- Smart contracts are computer codes that are built into blockchains in order to facilitate, verify, or negotiate contract agreements. They operate after users agree on terms of an agreement and set of conditions. Once the set of conditions are met the smart contract carries out the terms of the agreement. This helps participants of said agreements to be certain of the outcome without any type of intermediary.

3- The difference between a script and a transaction is that a transaction changes the data on the blockchain, whereas a script is used to view data on the blockchain. Transactions typically cost money to pay for gas fees, execution etc… This can be different amounts based on the blockchain you use. 

Day 2 quest- 
1- The five cadence programming pillars are: Safety/Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, and Resource Oriented Programming
These pillars are useful for new users to be able to learn cadence and develop smart contracts for the flow blockchain. Safety/Security is also useful because without it, nobody would want to use it.

Chapter 2 Day 2

1- The reason we would not call changeGreeting in a script is because a script is only used to view the information, it can not be used to actually change the data. 

2- In the prepare phase, Authaccount means that the user approves of the transaction. This is what actually allows the transaction to access the data within your account, which can only be done in the prepare phase.

3- The difference between the prepare and execute phase is that the information in your account can only be accessed in the prepare phase. The execute phase can call functions but is mainly utilized to separate the logic from the prepare phase in order to clear up the code.
